Welcome! 

About me:
My field of study is computer science because I believe in making mistakes,
seeing the results, and fixing them. That is life, and that is
computer science.

I pride myself in my wizardy googling skills, ability to click every hyper-link
I see, love of getting lost in wikipedia, debugging (code and life), and cheesily,
my love of learning. 

I do not seek perfection, I seek progress.
